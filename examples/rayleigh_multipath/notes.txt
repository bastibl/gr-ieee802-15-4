NOTES

I. The sampling rates of OQPSK and CSS are 4 MSps and 32 MSps, respectively. In order to simulate the same channel for both rates, the power delay profile is interpolated for the higher rate.
As there are no real standardized industrial indoor channel power delay profiles, a simple exponential function is used for simulation. The values of the PDP mark the variance of the filter taps, which are Gaussian. There magnitude is Rayleigh-distributed which models a NLOS scenario.

The PDP has a length of tau_max=320ns which limits the longest significant signal path to 320ns*3*10^8m/s = 96m

pdp(tau) = e^(-a*tau)
pdp(0) = 1 = 0 dB
pdp(tau_max) = .001 = -30 dB
a ~= 21586735

There are 11 taps for 32 MSps and 2 taps for 4 MSps. Considering that this is already a fairly long PDP (for indoor channels), most of the time even a single tap channel model for 4 MSps should suffice.

II. Because there is currently no synchronization algorithm implemented that can deal with the phase shift of the incoming multipaths, the channel impulse response's first (and strongest) tap is normalized to zero phase. The other taps' phases are shifted accordingly so that the relative phase difference between the taps stays the same.

III. Also due to the missing sync, the first samples of the continuous stream corresponding to the group delay of the channel filter have to be dropped because this is what a good synchronization algorithm would do.
